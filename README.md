# Hi Gamer ðŸ‘‹
I make games.
I'm Maurice Thompson-Hamilton (aka. BlackRece), a passionate game developer with a strong background in coding and a love for creating engaging gaming experiences, specialising in game mechanics. I thrive in collaborative team environments and always strive to push the boundaries of what's possible in game development.
