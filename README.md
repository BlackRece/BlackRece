# Hi Gamer ðŸ‘‹
I make games. Visit my Web-folio: [![Web-folio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Portfolio-Visit%20Site-brightgreen)](http://www.blackrece.co.uk)

I'm **Maurice Thompson-Hamilton** (aka. BlackRece), a passionate game developer with a strong background in coding and a love for creating engaging gaming experiences, specialising in game mechanics. I thrive in collaborative team environments and always strive to push the boundaries of what's possible in game development.

## Current Projects:
Here are some of the projects that I am currently working on:
### SwarmKilla:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/BlackRece/RefactaMasta.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/BlackRece/RefactaMasta)

This is a flocking birds simulation that is being refactored and fleshed out into an interactive demo. This will showcase the following:
- Windows: use of the Win32 api to create and manage a window, capturing and processing window/system message
- Graphics: use of DirectX 11 to facilitate the graphics pipeline, rendering to the window, manipulations of transforms, management of buffers, etc
- Autonomous Agents: use of Steering Behaviours to control the movement of entities in the game in a predictable manner as a means for enemy movement

## Team Projects: 
Here are some of the projects that I have worked on within a team:
### Nine-Byte-Warriors: [![Nine-Byte-Warriors](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Nine--Byte--Warriors-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/Nine-Byte-Warriors)
The C++ game engine, Roche, with an Antomicrops-inspired game called Midnight Harvest where my skills were put to work.
The tools that I created include:
- A projectile pattern tool that facilitated the creation of bullet-hell type projectile patterns.
- A artificial intelligence tool that furnished entities with steering behaviours, player tracking and shootting projectiles.

### CodeDamage: [![CodeDamage](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-TGPGame-blue.svg?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/code-damage/TGPGame)
Dragn'tor is a Unity tower defence game created in the second year of study at Staffordshire University, where I developed a procedurally generated terrain using perlin noise to randomise terrain features such as hills and valleys for AI controlled entities to traverse. I created enemies, towers and terrain tiles in a 3D modeling app and used Unity's navmesh to enable enemies to path around the generated map.
